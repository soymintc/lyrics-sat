# Lyrics with "nice" translations
When lyrics are translated, they often either 
1. lose the true meaning it used to confer, or
2. lose the rhyme or rhythm it used to have.
The purpose of this repo is to collect a set of lyrics that try to best conserve both the true meaning and/or the rhyme/rhythm of the lyric.

## Structure
- one song, multiple translations
- translations are marked by the origin and destination languages, and how the translations have been made (e.g. by chatGPT, manually by conserving rhyme, manually by conserving meaning, etc.)

## Help!
Any participation is dearly welcome! @soymintc would be initially focusing on Korean to English translations of some songs to his best interest.
