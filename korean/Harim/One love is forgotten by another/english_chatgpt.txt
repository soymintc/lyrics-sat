I thought we would run into each other someday
I just recognized you at first sight
You who seems changed but hasn’t changed
Sometimes I feel resentful
That the feelings from before have disappeared
That the fervent promises made before have been discarded, even if they seem meaningless now
It's a natural thing
Let's stop feeling sorry

It's all in the past
No matter who hurt whom
You remain through the song that sometimes makes me cry helplessly
I believed in it for a moment
Even when I couldn’t sleep and tossed and turned
Before I knew it, someone who would hold my hand appeared

Love is forgotten with another love
We look good as we are
There are no regrets
Believe in that smile
Let it flow while believing

It's all in the past
No matter who hurt whom
You remain through the song that sometimes makes me cry helplessly
I believed in it for a moment
Even when I couldn’t sleep and tossed and turned
Before I knew it, someone who would hold my hand appeared
Love is forgotten with another love
We look good as we are
There are no regrets
Believe in that smile
Someday in the future, will we be able to meet like this again?
Will I be able to recognize you then?
Lalala lalala
We look good as we are
Let it flow as it is
The me you knew
Now, I don't even know myself
Lalala lalala
