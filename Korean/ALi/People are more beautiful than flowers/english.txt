People keeping melodies inside, that sound like the river know,
understand, yes, they understand,
Mountains there having kept their shadows, when the night comes,
Why do they smear into the river, dreaming,
as the night deeps, wordlessly, caressing each other,
keeping tugged in and, leisurely being enchanted by each other?

People gone through isolation, that dessicates their souls know,
understand, yes, they understand,
Not succumbing to that sorrow, never stepping aside from it,
At some point, sealing up, the glittering flower buds,
verdantly leafing out, such flourishing love,
grows forests and, mountains, that will echo throughout the years

No matter others, people are more beautiful than flowers
Gone through isolations, indeed they have, those people here
No matter others, people are more beautiful than flowers
Embracing the warmth of songs inside of, yes you, yes you, yes us, we're true love
We're true love, true love
