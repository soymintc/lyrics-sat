The person who lives embracing a song like a river
Becomes aware, hmm, becomes aware
When the mountains that were always dark become evening
Why do they blend into the river and dream
As the night deepens
Silently caressing each other
Leisurely while embracing Becoming fond of each other

The person who has struggled with severe loneliness
Becomes aware, hmm, becomes aware
Not succumbing to that sorrow
Not stepping aside
At some point, closing the sparkling flower buds
Loudly growing the leaves
Love indeed
Becomes a deep green forest and a mountain Remaining as an echo

No matter what anyone says, a person is more beautiful than a flower
That very person who has overcome all this loneliness
No matter what anyone says, you are more beautiful than a flower
Embracing the warmth of the song
Exactly you, exactly you, exactly
We, we are true love
We are true love, true love
