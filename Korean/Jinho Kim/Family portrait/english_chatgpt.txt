To your bustling youth,
A child adds meaning,
And within the family photo taken that day,
The excited laughter fades,
But thrown into reality as an adult,
I become a child without wisdom,
Breaking here and there, then standing up again,
In the photo taken out on a lonely day,
I resemble my father.

As my youth is tilting towards its end,
Only then do your days become visible,
Our young mom in the family photo, smiling,
The blooming days return to me,
Becoming the fertilizer to bloom me,
I gather those scorched times cleanly—

Wishing for your laughter to bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom.

Becoming the fertilizer to bloom me,
I gather those scorched times cleanly—

Wishing for your laughter to bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom,
To bloom.

For everyone you love,
May the wisdom to bloom laughter,
To live the present, always accompany you.
Thank you.
