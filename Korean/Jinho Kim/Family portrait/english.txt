To your youth that you've been busily living by
has now come this new child adding more values in
Within our photograph celebrating the day
Excited laughters though slowly fading away
I grew up and have been thrown into reality
Immature still I am, haven't yet grown up full
Breaking here and there, then again managing to stand up,
On this lonely day, I looked into our photograph
I look just like my dad

As my youth, before I knew, tilting towards its end,
Only then does your days become vivid to me
In our old photograph, showing mom, then young and smily,
Flourishing days you had are now passed onto me from you
And to bloom my days your own youth, have become composted and soiled,
All those dusted, composted days, would I gladly gather up for you-

And have your smiles again blooming
Blooming
Blooming
Blooming

And to bloom my days your own youth, have become composted and soiled,
All those dusted, composted days, would I gladly gather up for you-

And have your smiles again blooming
Blooming
Blooming
Blooming
Blooming
Blooming

For everyone you love,
May the wisdom to bloom their laughter,
to live the present, always accompany you.
Thank you
