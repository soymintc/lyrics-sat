I had this thought some day, we would run into each other again,
I had you recognized at my first glance,
You look like you have changed, but haven't really changed
Do you sometimes feel bad,
that the past feelings have ceized to exist?
Past hot promises thrown may now be colorless
It's only natural to be
Let's stop feeling too sorry now

It's all now in the past
Non matters now who have hurted whom
You remain as a song that sometimes make me weep helplessly
This too shall pass, I thought
Sleeplessly did I toss and turn
Before long appeared a warming hand,
from another good-hearted soul

One love, is only forgotten by another love
I think we look good as we are standing now
There lingers no regrets
Try believing in that smile
Let it flow as you believe

It's all now in the past
Non matters now who have hurted whom
You remain as a song that sometimes make me weep helplessly
This too shall pass, I thought
Sleeplessly did I toss and turn
Before long appeared a warming hand,
from another good-hearted soul

One love, is forgotten by another love
I think we look good as we are standing now
There lingers no regrets
Try believing in that smile

Once again, far from now,
could we run into each other again?
Could we then recognize?
lalala lalala
We look good as we are now
Let it flow as it is now
The me that you have known,
now even I don't know.
lalala lalala
